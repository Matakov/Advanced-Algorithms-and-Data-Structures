# Advanced-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
This respository containes laboratory assignments for university course Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures.<br/>
University course took place in winter semester 2017.

All laboratory assignments had a list of possible problems to solve and a number of points you could get for solving them.<br/>
First laboratoy assignment was to create AVL tree and implement adding nodes and deleting nodes. It was written in java.<br/>
Second laboratory assignment was to solve some kind of problem using genetic algorithms. I chose to solve traveling salesman problem using genetic algorithm. Assignment was boosted using graphics from some java tutorial. Graphics were used to input "cities" that salesman needed to go to, and graphics were used to show best result in every generation as well as final result.<br/>
